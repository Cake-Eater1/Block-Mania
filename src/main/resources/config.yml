Detection:
  Hitbox:
    #increasing this could lead to performance drops
    #these performance drops would most likely be small until the extremes
    #by increasing this it changes the size of the hitbox which detects if the player is inside
    #Default: 4
    x:
      4
    y:
      4
    z:
      4
  Delay:
    #delay in ticks before the detection should start
    #increase this when also increasing "Hitbox" else it will detect the player firing
    #increasing this will lead to marginal better performance
    #Default: 10
    10
  Period:
    #Period in which the detection happens in ticks
    #increasing this will make detection less reliable
    #increase this with size of hitbox to mitigate the performance hit
    #Cannot be lowered below 1
    #Default: 1
    1

Firing:
  Offset:
    #Change this to change the offset of blocks spawned
    #Decreasing Y would lower the block farther into the players head
